# LUDICROUS KEY

Ludicrous Key is a way on macOS to make the Caps Lock key act like an extra
modifier key that you can use in any application that lets you assign custom
keyboard shortcuts.  Rather than having to figure out if Command-Shift-D is
in use for something else, you can use CapsLock-Shift-D which you can guarantee
no other application has already assigned.

Unlike other "Hyper Key" solutions offered by several applications, Ludicrous
Key configures your Caps Lock key to work in conjunction with other modifier keys,
so you can assign different shortcuts depending on if you're holding down
extra modifier keys alongside Caps Lock.

## What's here?

This repository is the source code that builds the Ludicrous Key configuration
for Karabiner Elements.

If you want to install Ludicrous Key, don't look here - go look at the website.

## Can I take the ideas from Ludicrous Key and build it into my own application?

Yes!

If you make any of the excellent utilities that offer "Hyper Key" support,
you're encouraged to take this code and/or ideas build it into your application.
Go forth and give everyone easy access to power tools!
